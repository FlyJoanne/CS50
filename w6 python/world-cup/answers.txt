Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, not all the teams have a chance greater than 0 to win.
But when we increase times of simulations, gradually all teams have a shot at winning, albeit the possibilities vary a lot.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 100o times of simulation.
