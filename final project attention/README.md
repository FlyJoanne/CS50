#### Description:

This web page mainly introduces the debut song attention and members of the South Korean girl group new jeans.

# 1. Song introduction
## 1.1 Lyrics link:
[Attention is what I want](https://lyrics.lyricfind.com/lyrics/newjeans-attention)
First, the lyrics are inserted at the first underline. I originally wanted to insert specific text in sections, but considering that with too many words in the page, it would look cluttered and not concise enough, so I gave up. And very subtly, "attention is what i want" is not only one of the lyrics of the song, but also instructs people to pay attention to the link and click on it. Amazing!

## 1.2 Performance video link:
[youtube video embedded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG54RjPx0m8)
Then, there are the youtube performance videos that are inserted, so that people can immediately feel the charm of the members and the song, just like the videos provided in CS50 web pages!In fact, I originally wanted to insert the music video of this song, but although youtube provides the option of embedding, it can not be played directly on this page due to regional restrictions or other reasons, so I chose the performance video.


## 1.3 Basic information as a small table
Since the song is not only the efforts of the members, but also the efforts of the producers, the introduction of basic information is added. And also, the visitors might wonder when this song is released, what type it is, and how long does it take to finish the whole song...Funny story! Play it for three times and then when you hear the first chorus at the fourth time, bang! Ten minutes have passed! It is quite a useful method to know about time when you are in a hurry to go out...

# 2. Members introduction
## 2.1 A funny draw button
Then there's a funny draw button that allows people to repeatedly choose which member to get to know this time. As you might notice, each member's name has a different color, which is their own representative color. If you are also a bunny(fans of New Jeans), you can surely recall that for "New Jeans" performance, the members dressed different clothes of different colors! Minji is blue, Hanni is pink, Danielle is orange, Haerin is green, and Hyein is purple!

## 2.2 Picture with links
Lastly there are five photos of the members, all with names attached, so that you can click on the photos of the members according to the results of the button lottery to jump to the detailed profile of the members. Isn't that convenient?! It really took me a while to adjust the size of the pictures so they can lie in a row and can be viewed comfortably.
